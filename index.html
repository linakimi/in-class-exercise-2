    <p>
      This <b>mystery</b> in Peak was finally answered and it makes <em>total sense.</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
      When starting a match, one of the first things you may never notice on the shore is the conch shells that are everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        But when you pick them up, you slowly figure out that they are useless.
    </p>
        You can't eat them after cooking it or use it as a projectile. 
    <p>
        It simpli fills up a slot and weighs a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        So why is it in the game?
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, the creators of the game recently explaines why.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aggro crab, one of the main developers, stated that it was an easter egg to another of their games. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another Crabs Treasure, which was their most recently released game besides Peak. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The conch shell is of course a reference to Krill's shell at the beginning of the game.
