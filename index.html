      Mysteries of Peak

    <p>
      This <b>mystery</b> in Peak was finally answered and it makes <em>total sense.</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
      When starting a match, one of the first things you may never notice on the shore is the conch shells that are <b>everywhere.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        But when you pick them up, you <em>slowly figure out</em> that they are <i>useless.</i>
    </p>
        You <b>can't</b> eat them after cooking it or use it as a projectile. 
    <p>
        It <i>simply</i> fills up a slot and weighs a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        So <b>why</b> is it in the game?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Well...</b> the creators of the game recently <i>explaines why.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Aggro crab,</b> one of the main developers, stated that it was an <i>easter egg</i> to another of their games. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Another Crabs Treasure,</b></i> which was their most recently released game besides Peak. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The conch shell is of course a <em>reference</em> to Krill's shell at the beginning of the game.
