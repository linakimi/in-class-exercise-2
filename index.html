      Mysteries of Peak

    <p>
      This <b>mystery</b> in <i>Peak</i> was finally answered and it makes <em>total sense.</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
      When starting a match, one of the first things <em>you may never notice</em> on the shore is the conch shells that are <b>everywhere.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        But when you pick them up, you <em>slowly figure out</em> that they are <b>useless.</b>
    </p>
        You <b>can't</b> eat them after cooking it or use it as a projectile. 
    <p>
        It <b>simply</b> fills up a slot and weighs a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        So <em>why</em> is it in the game?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Well...</b> the creators of the game recently <i>explains why.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Aggro crab,</i> one of the main developers, stated that it was an <b>easter egg</b> to another of their games. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Another Crabs Treasure,</b></i> which was their most recently released game besides Peak. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The conch shell is <em>of course</em> a <b>reference</b> to <i>Krill's</i> shell at the beginning of the game.
